After completing this lab you will be able to:

Measure the time it takes to execute a query with the explain function
Describe the process of creating, listing and deleting indexes
Evaluate the effectiveness of an index

-------------------------------------------------------

// Select the training database.

use training

// Create a collection named bigdata.

db.createCollection("bigdata")
show collections

/* Insert documents

Let us insert a lot of documents into the newly created collection.
This should take around 3 minutes, so please be patient.
The code given below will insert 200000 documents into the ‘bigdata’ collection.
Each document would have a field named account_no which is a simple auto increment number.
And a field named balance which is a randomly generated number, to simulate the bank balance for the account.
Copy the below code and paste it on the mongo client.

*/

use training
for (i=1;i<=200000;i++){print(i);db.bigdata.insert({"account_no":i,"balance":Math.round(Math.random()*1000000)})}

// Verify that 200000 documents got inserted by running the below command.

db.bigdata.countDocuments()

//create an index on the field account_no.

db.bigdata.createIndex({"account_no":1})

//get a list of indexes on the ‘bigdata’ collection.
db.bigdata.getIndexes()

//delete the index we created earlier.
db.bigdata.dropIndex({"account_no":1})
